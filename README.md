Quly is a multiplatform cross-genre open world indie video game, currently in early stages of development.

In Quly you control your family of Qules - spherical objects from matter and energy. Energy holds the matter together (in clusters) and allows Qule to perform various actions. Energy regenerates over time, but if at any given moment reaches zero, the matter will disintegrate and the Qule dies.

Qule uses its energy for movement, interactions with others, storing knowledge, fights (offense as well as defense), communication or doing stuff. Energy structure is unique for each family, which allows family members to communicate, heal each other and transfer knowledge among themselves via energy, but it hurts Qules from other families.

How fast the energy flows inside a Qule is described as Energy Power, which determines how fast the Qule is, how far it can beam energy, how high it can jump and how powerful its attacks, heals or actions are (decreasing with distance).

Energy sacks, formed around every matter cluster, allows Qule to address certain skills and knowledge, stored by the energy. Qules can learn various skills, extend them by learning new recipes and enhance them by performing them, while unused skills will be slowly forgotten.

Matter consists of one or several materials, which are evenly distributed across the Qule. Different materials provide different stats, like energy properties, weight and color. Amount of matter clusters determines Qule's maximum energy.

Large damage can break off some matter, which decreases the energy cap, until the missing matter is replaced. Qule can obtain materials for matter by gathering, mining, harvesting, crafting, trading or shopping, where rare multipurpose material "Qulium" serves as a currency.

Qulium provides everything for Qule's basic needs. It could be decomposed to more basic materials using other materials as solvents. It can't be synthesized though, only gathered or mined.

You start your game with just a single Qule. Further in the game you can fissure them indefinitely, which enables you to do more at once or even to create your own empire. Each fission increases energy capacity and decreases energy regeneration of the parent Qule and child Qule inherites stats, as they were before fission, from the parent.

Qule gains one inventory slot, but cannot use the item inside while moving and with an item inside a regeneration rate is decreased significantly. Later can Qule expand itself to accomodate up to six items, but then will use up all energy it produces just to hold together, so it can't move. You can get more energy for slow movement from nested Qules, but if you want to move and use items at the same time, you have to equip the Qule with an engine. It is possible to use more than six items at once by coupling multiple expanded Qules into a train.

For storing items, materials and equipment, as well as for better energy regeneration, Qule might build houses, which may be upgraded to suit more Qules and offer better services.
